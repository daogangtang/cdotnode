## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities in Kulupu should be reported by email. Your report should include the following:

- your name
- description of the vulnerability
- attack scenario (if any)
- components
- reproduction
- other details

Try to include as much information in your report as you can, including a description of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and steps for reproducing it. Be sure to use a descriptive subject line.

You'll receive a response to your email indicating the next steps in handling your report. We encourage finders to use encrypted communication channels to protect the confidentiality of vulnerability reports. You should encrypt your report using our public key.

After the initial reply to your report, our team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix.

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

## Responsible Investigation and Reporting

Responsible investigation and reporting includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Don't violate the privacy of other users, destroy data, etc.
- Donâ€™t defraud or harm Kulupu or its users during your research; you should make a good faith effort to not interrupt or degrade our services.
- Don't target our physical security measures, or attempt to use social engineering, spam, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, etc.
- Initially report the bug only to us and not to anyone else.
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the bug before disclosing it to anyone else, and give us adequate written warning before disclosing it to anyone else.
- In general, please investigate and report bugs in a way that makes a reasonable, good faith effort not to be disruptive or harmful to us or our users. Otherwise your actions might be interpreted as an attack rather than an effort to be helpful.
